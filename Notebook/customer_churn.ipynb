    "`Introduction:` Vodafone Corporation is the largest pan-European and African telecoms company. They provide mobile and fixed services to over 300 million customers in 17 countries, partner with mobile networks in 45 more and have one of the worldâ€™s largest IoT platforms. Vodafone purpose is to connect for a better future by using technology to improve lives, businesses and help progress inclusive sustainable societies.\n",
    "Vodafone Corporation faces the ubiquitous challenge of customer churn. Churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with the company, poses significant financial implications and threatens customer satisfaction. To mitigate this challenge and proactively retain valuable customers, Vodafone seeks to implement a Customer Churn Prediction system. This system aims to identify customers at risk of churning based on their behavioral patterns and characteristics, enabling targeted retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Goal`: The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying customers who are likely to churn from Vodafone's services. By leveraging historical customer data encompassing demographics, usage patterns, subscription history, and churn status, the model must forecast the likelihood of churn for individual customers within a specified time frame. The predicted churn probabilities will enable Vodafone to prioritize retention efforts and deploy targeted interventions to retain at-risk customers, thereby reducing churn rates and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.\n",
