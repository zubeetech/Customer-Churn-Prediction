1. Business Understanding (Stakeholders input)
    - Goal
    - Hypothesis
    - Analytical Questions
    - More Information about the project if applicable
2. Data Understanding
    - Load Dataset 
    - Clean dataset
    - EDA(info, describe, duplicates, appropriate columns)
    - Univariate (Histogram, check for outliers, check density plots)
    - Bivariate Analysis (Pair plots, correlation heatmap, etc)
    - Multivariate Analysis (PCA)
    - Answer Analytical Questions
    - Test Hypothesis
3. Data Preparation
    - Check if dataset is balanced (Visualize)
    - Split data into X and y & (train & eval)
    - Encode y labels
    - Create your transformers based on your understanding of the the data so far (imputation, sclaing, balancing, functional_transformations)
4. Modelling & Evaluation
    - Choose models to train (distance, gradient descent, tree-based + )
    - Train on Unbalanced dataset (if applicable)
    - Train on balanced data (if applicable)
    - Hyperparameter Tuning
    - Model Persistance
